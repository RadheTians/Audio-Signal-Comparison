# Audio Signal Comparison


Took two same speech audio signals(apple-like sound) and remove noise by using the Thresholding method.


Normalized both signals and create frame for both signals.

Applied various filters to remove remain noise and calculate Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients(MFCCs) of both
signals.


Got 38% similarity by Cosine Similarity method.
